This is my first glfw/OpenGL renderer project.

I am using this for learning purposes and this is also my first program to be written in C++

Current issues:

- Shader compilation failing

--------------------------

Todo:

- Create a triangle :D
- Create a rectangle
- Create an interactable 3D space (first person stuff)
